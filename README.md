# CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

## About this project
Saya membuat aplikasi yang mirip seperti Google Classroom. guru dapat membuat kelas, kemiudian memposting materi dan tugas. Sedangkan murid dapat memberi komentar pada postingan materi dan dapat mengumpulkan tugas

## Distinctiveness and Complexity
Even though I made an application like Google Classroom, my application looks not completely the same as Google Classroom. In terms of complexity, this application uses quite complicated queries to the database, many display changes in the same page, and there are many url routes
